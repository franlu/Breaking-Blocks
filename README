=============================   BREAKING BLOCKS   ==============================
================================================================================

It is playing Breaking Blocks in a rectangular panel using the dimensions
entered by the user to start the game.
The board should create as blocks containing random numbers from 0 to 9. The
player must choose a block to delete given by its position on the board. You can
only delete a block that is at an adjacent (left, right, up or down the block
chosen) labeled with the same number. Once you select a block deletes all blocks
that have the same number and are adjacent to another block removed.
The remaining blocks fall down without leaving any gaps in the columns of the
board.
If any column is empty then the columns to the left of the column selected block
will move to the right, to fill gaps that have occurred. The player wins if at
the end of the game has no block on the board.

We used 2 different representations to the board:
* vector <vector <char> >: classic board fixed size given as parameter.
* list <list <char> >: Board column lists the board, where the columns are in
                       turn lists.
